# this is a variable with the value of a integer
a = " abv"
# this is a varible with the value of a string

# this is a variable with the Value True

# this is a variable with the value of a float

# you can check what type a varible is by using the type() command
print(type(a))
# variables are also case sensitive, that is a != A

# variables cannot start with a number, for eg if i try this
2a = 5
print(2a)
# error invalid syntax should show up
# this is also the case for symbols
# it is advised to use snake case while nameing variables. this means
panda_ml_1 = 0
# is preferred compared to this
PandaMl1 - 0
