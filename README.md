# Python Guide #
A guide created by Aarav Navani to help my classmates out with python

## Using this guide ##
Each section will be split up into individual folders for example `0-Getting-Started`. Each section represents a chapter which goes over a particular topic.

Each section will have python files (ending with `.py`) that represent a practical example of any theory or code bits discussed in the sections.

It is recommended but not necessary to go through the sections in order. Once completed take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/shift-eleven/python-guide/wiki) for examples and questions to test your newfound skills.
